## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4, part 1
This lab was very fun and was my first difficult lab I had done. This lab was challenging because I was writing a program that converted a measurement of volume from millimeters to  the measurements of the metric system. This lab challenged me, but I liked how rewarding it was after I was able ti finish it and get a good grade on it.

Lab 9, Part 2
I liked this lab a lot because it was the first time graeting a guessing game from the ground up. I enjoyed doing the lab and writing the code to make the guessing game come to life. I learned a lot about my ability to write code in this lab which had helped me improve in my ability to write code.

Lab 12, part 1
This lab was one of my favorite labs because I loved creating the colorful animation. It was also hard but I loved how worked out in the end. My favorite part was seeing how everything I did could be seen through the differebt colors being seen. Although it was one of the hardest labs, it was also one of my favorites because I could actually visually see what I had created with the help of my partner.
